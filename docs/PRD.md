## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Vision

The RFQ Engine is a serverless, GraphQL-first Request for Quote management platform that powers intelligent, automated B2B procurement and hospitality quoting workflows. It combines deterministic pricing calculation with AI-driven discount negotiation, enabling organizations to generate, negotiate, and finalize quotes through a unified API that integrates seamlessly with AI assistants via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Organizations managing RFQ workflows face three persistent challenges:

1. **Manual, error-prone pricing**: Pricing teams manually compute tiered prices across segments, providers, and volume thresholds, leading to inconsistencies and margin leakage.
2. **Opaque discount authority**: Discount decisions lack structured guardrails, making it hard to enforce pricing policies while still allowing flexibility for negotiations.
3. **Fragmented supplier communication**: RFQ distribution, quote collection, and supplier comparison require manual coordination across disconnected tools.

### 1.3 Target Users

| User Persona | Role | Key Needs |
|---|---|---|
| **Procurement Manager** | Initiates RFQs, compares supplier quotes | Fast quote generation, multi-provider comparison, transparent pricing |
| **Sales Representative** | Responds to RFQs with quotes | Accurate tier pricing, discount authority, negotiation tracking |
| **Pricing Administrator** | Configures tiers, segments, discount policies | Structured rule authoring, validation, scope management |
| **AI Assistant (via MCP)** | Orchestrates end-to-end RFQ workflows | 28 high-level tools, batch-optimized queries, status automation |
| **Hospitality Operator** | Quotes rooms, events, transfers, packages | Service-dated inventory, occupancy/PAX pricing, availability holds, cancellation terms |
| **Integration Engineer** | Connects external systems | GraphQL API, DynamoDB schema, catalog mapping, MCP protocol |

### 1.4 Product Differentiators

1. **AI-native discount system**: Discount prompts combine machine-readable tiered rules with natural-language instructions for LLM-driven negotiation decisions, bounded by `max_discount_percentage` guardrails.
2. **Hospitality without a separate engine**: Service-dated batches, PAX/occupancy pricing, availability holds, FX conversion, and cancellation snapshots extend the procurement core without branching into a separate product line.
3. **Batch-optimized GraphQL**: DataLoader pattern eliminates N+1 queries, achieving 97% reduction in database reads (153 to 5 queries for typical workflows) and sub-200ms p95 latency for nested queries.
4. **Multi-tenant serverless**: AWS Lambda + DynamoDB with `partition_key` tenant isolation; zero infrastructure management at the API layer.

## 4. System Architecture

### 4.1 Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| API | Graphene (Python) | GraphQL schema, resolvers, types |
| Database | Amazon DynamoDB | 18 tables, multi-tenant partitioning |
| Compute | AWS Lambda | Serverless function execution |
| Framework | SilvaEngine | Custom Python framework (BaseModel, Graphql, utilities) |
| ORM | PynamoDB | DynamoDB model definitions and queries |
| Batch Loading | promise.DataLoader | N+1 query elimination |
| Cache | HybridCacheEngine | Multi-layer caching (application, request, method) |
| AI Integration | MCP Protocol | 28 tools for AI-driven RFQ workflows |
| Testing | pytest | Parametrized tests, fixtures, markers |

### 4.2 Architectural Patterns

1. **Lazy Loading with Nested Resolvers**: Related data fetched only when requested by the client via GraphQL field resolvers, reducing payload size and unnecessary DB reads.

2. **DataLoader Batch Optimization**: Collects individual entity lookups within a single GraphQL request and batches them into minimal DB queries. Request-scoped `RequestLoaders` container manages 19+ loaders per request.

3. **Three-Layer Caching**:
   - **Application Cache**: Schema and static configuration
   - **Request Cache (DataLoader)**: Deduplication within a single GraphQL request
   - **Method Cache (`@method_cache`)**: Cross-request caching via `HybridCacheEngine`

4. **Multi-Tenant Partitioning**: Every table uses `partition_key` (or `endpoint_id`) as the hash key for tenant isolation. Cross-tenant queries are structurally impossible at the data layer.

5. **Derived Field Auto-Calculation**: Fields like `total_cost_per_uom`, `guardrail_price_per_uom`, `price_per_uom`, `subtotal`, `final_subtotal`, `installment_ratio`, and quote totals are computed by the engine and never manually set.

### 4.3 Data Model

The engine manages **18 DynamoDB tables** organized into five domain layers:

```
Catalog Layer:
  are-items, are-provider_items, are-provider_item_batches,
  are-item_catalog_refs, are-bundles, are-bundle_components

Pricing Layer:
  are-item_price_tiers, are-discount_prompts, are-fx_rates,
  are-cancellation_policies

Segmentation Layer:
  are-segments, are-segment_contacts

RFQ Workflow Layer:
  are-requests, are-quotes, are-quote_items, are-installments

Operations Layer:
  are-availability_holds, are-files
```

### 4.4 GraphQL Surface

**Queries**: 26 root query fields covering entity lookups, filtered lists, and cross-entity batch lookups (e.g. `itemPriceTiers`, `discountPrompts`, `itemCatalogRefs`).

**Mutations**: 32 mutations covering CRUD for all entities, plus 4 availability hold operations (`acquire`, `release`, `confirm`, `expire`).

---

## 5. Pricing Calculation

### 5.1 Two-Stage Pipeline

The engine implements a deterministic two-stage pricing pipeline:

**Stage 1 - Price Calculation**:
1. Resolve customer segment from email via `SegmentContact`
2. Match active `ItemPriceTier` by (item, provider item, segment, qty range)
3. Apply pricing mode:
   - `unit`: `price_per_uom * qty`
   - `per_pax_type`: `sum(pax_breakdown[t] * tier_price(t))`; `qty` must equal total pax
   - `occupancy`: `(base_rate + per-pax surcharges for guests beyond base_occupancy) * qty`
4. If tier uses `margin_per_uom`, compute from batch costs: `total_cost * (1 + margin/100)`
5. Slow-move items use `guardrail_price_per_uom` as floor price

**Stage 2 - Discount Application**:
1. Load applicable discount prompts across scope hierarchy (GLOBAL -> SEGMENT -> ITEM -> PROVIDER_ITEM)
2. AI evaluates prompt text, conditions, and `discount_rules` to decide `subtotal_discount`
3. Discount bounded by `max_discount_percentage` from matching tier rule
4. `final_subtotal = subtotal - subtotal_discount`
5. Quote totals are recalculated across all items

### 5.2 FX Conversion

When a quote carries a locked FX rate and `display_currency` differs from native `currency`:
- `subtotal_native` stores the supplier-currency amount
- `subtotal` stores the display-currency converted amount (`subtotal_native * fx_rate`)
- No silent default to rate 1.0 — same-currency quotes skip conversion entirely

## 6. Availability and Hold Lifecycle

```
                      acquireAvailabilityHold
                              │
                              ▼
                    ┌──────────────────┐
                    │     held         │
                    │ (15-min TTL)     │
                    └──┬────┬────┬────┘
                       │    │    │
            confirm    │    │    │   expireAvailabilityHold
                       │    │    │
                       ▼    │    ▼
              ┌──────────┐  │  ┌──────────┐
              │confirmed │  │  │ expired  │
              └──────────┘  │  └──────────┘
                            │
                     releaseAvailabilityHold
                            │
                            ▼
                     ┌──────────┐
                     │ released │
                     └──────────┘
```

- **Acquire**: Conditional `TransactWrite` decrements `availability_qty` and inserts hold record
- **Confirm**: On quote acceptance; no second capacity decrement
- **Release**: On quote-item deletion; restores capacity once (idempotent)
- **Expire**: Scanner transitions abandoned holds; restores capacity once

| MCP / AI agent orchestration | External package (`mcp_rfq_processor`) |
| Persisted parent bundle line or nested package row | By design — `bundle_uuid` grouping only |
